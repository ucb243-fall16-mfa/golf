Description: This package provides a function to perform MFA, and to find
    related quantities of interest, such as eigenvalues, factor scores, and
    loadings. Supplementary functions calculate information related to between-
    table structure. MFA is a technique used when one has multiple data sets
    collected about the same group of objects. This package has examples based
    on a fictional wine data set: 10 different wine critics assessed the same
    12 wines.
